# /etc/inittab: busybox init configuration.
#
# inittab format is this:
#
#   id:runlevels:action:process
# 
# id is used by busybox to specify the controlling tty to run the process
# on. So if id is 'tty2' process will run on /dev/tty2. If no id is given then
# init's stdin/stdout are used.
#
# runlevels are completely ignored by busybox init and that is fine by Terry.
#
# action is one of:
#
#   - sysinit
#     + First thing to run on boot.
#     + init waits for these to finish.
#   - once
#     + One time action.
#     + Asynchronously fired and forgotten.
#   - restart
#     + When init needs to be restarted.
#   - ctrlaltdel
#     + When someone hits Control+Alt+Delete on the system console.
#   - shutdown
#     + Actions halt or reboot the system.
#   - respawn
#     + Do again once process exits.
#     + Warning: Busybox init does not have tty on fire protection.
#     + By that I mean it won't say this thing exited to fast, delay!
#     + Don't use with a paper fed teletypewriter!
#   - askfirst
#     + "Please press Enter to active this console."
#
# Unknown actions and bad inittab entries are just error messages.
# Error safety FTW!
#
# process is the command line to run. Make it count.
#

#
## Default TOS initialization.

::sysinit:/etc/rc/startup
::sysinit:/etc/rc.local/startup
::shutdown:/etc/rc/shutdown
::sysinit:/etc/rc.local/shutdown
::restart:/sbin/init

#
## Setup the core TTYs.

tty2::askfirst:-/bin/sh
tty3::askfirst:-/bin/sh

#
## Uncomment these to enable more ttys.
#
## tty5, tty7, and tty8 are popular choices for running X.
